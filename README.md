My Ethereum Offline Wallet (meow) script

## Background

Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed consensus technology similiar to Bitcoin.
Use of Ethereum requires the establishment of a digital 'wallet' which contains cryptographic materials.
The cryptographic materials may be used to access value encoded in the blockchain.

A key risk of using Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other blockchain-based technology is the loss of the wallet-based cryptographic materials.
This may occur through misfortune or the misdeeds of others.
Best practice in mitigating this risk is to store the cryptographic materials 'offline'  by literally printing them on paper and then destroying any online copies so they may not be accessed using digital means.

The Ethereum project is approaching a public launch and focussed on technologies core to the global release.
A script or method for easily creating offline wallets has not been provided by the core team.
This project attempts to provide a script for rudimentary functionality that may be built upon to securely and easily generate the required cryptographic materials and store them offline.

Having no expertise in Ethereum, this is being used as a learning opportunity.
The code is provided without warranty or guarantee. 
Use at your own risk.
